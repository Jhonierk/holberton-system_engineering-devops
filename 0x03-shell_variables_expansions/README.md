# The Shell, init files, variables and expansions commands

## Alias:
The alias command makes it possible to launch any command or group of commands (inclusive of any options, arguments and redirection) by entering a pre-set string (i.e., sequence of characters).

That is, it allows a user to create simple names or abbreviations (even consisting of just a single character) for commands regardless of how complex the original commands are and then use them in the same way that ordinary commands are used.
